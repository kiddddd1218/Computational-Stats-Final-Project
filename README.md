## About<!-- Required -->
<!-- 
* information about the project 
* 
* keep it short and sweet
--> This is the final project of MA-GY 6973-I/MATH-GA 2080-001 Computational Statistics. We build a parallel alternating least square (ALS) recommender system and compare it with known ALS packages. The test is conducted on both the MovieLens dataset and synthetic data.
